   Cloud computing metaphor: For a user, the network elements representing
   the provider-rendered services are invisible, as if obscured by a
   cloud.

   Cloud computing is an [7]information technology (IT) paradigm, a model
   for enabling ubiquitous access to shared pools of configurable
   resources (such as computer networks, servers, storage, applications
   and services),^[8][1]^[9][2] which can be rapidly [10]provisioned with
   minimal management effort, often over the [11]Internet. Cloud computing
   allows users and enterprises with various computing capabilities to
   store and process data either in a privately-owned cloud, or on a
   third-party server located in a [12]data center - thus making
   data-accessing mechanisms more efficient and
   reliable.^[13][3]^[[14]need quotation to verify] Cloud computing relies
   on sharing of resources to achieve [15]coherence and [16]economy of
   scale, similar to a [17]utility.

   Advocates note that cloud computing allows [18]companies to avoid or
   minimize up-front [19]IT infrastructure costs. As well, third-party
   clouds enable organizations to focus on their [20]core businesses
   instead of expending resources on computer infrastructure and
   maintenance.^[21][4] Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows
   enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with
   improved manageability and less maintenance, and that it enables IT
   [22]teams to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and
   unpredictable [23]business demand.^[24][4]^[25][5]^[26][6] Cloud
   providers typically use a [27]"pay-as-you-go" model. This could lead to
   unexpectedly high charges if administrators are not familiarized with
   cloud-pricing models.^[28][7]

   In 2009 the availability of high-capacity networks, low-cost computers
   and storage devices as well as the widespread adoption of [29]hardware
   virtualization, [30]service-oriented architecture, and [31]autonomic
   and [32]utility computing led to a growth in cloud
   computing.^[33][8]^[34][9]^[35][10] Companies can scale up as computing
   needs increase and then scale down again when demands
   decrease.^[36][11] In 2013 it was reported^[[37]by whom?] that cloud
   computing had become a highly demanded service or utility due to the
   advantages of high computing power, cheap cost of services, high
   performance, scalability, and accessibility - as well as availability.
   Some cloud vendors experience growth rates of 50% per year,^[38][12]
   but while cloud computing remains in a stage of infancy, it has
   pitfalls that need to be addressed^[[39]by whom?] to make
   cloud-computing services more reliable and
   user-friendly.^[40][13]^[41][14]

History[[75]edit]

Origin of the term[[76]edit]

   The origin of the term cloud computing is unclear. The word cloud is
   commonly used in science to describe a large agglomeration of objects
   that visually appear from a distance as a cloud and describes any set
   of things whose details are not further inspected in a given
   context.^[77][15] Another explanation is that the old programs that
   drew network schematics surrounded the icons for servers with a circle,
   and a cluster of servers in a network diagram had several overlapping
   circles, which resembled a cloud.^[78][16] In analogy to the above
   usage, the word cloud was used as a metaphor for the Internet and a
   standardized cloud-like shape was used to denote a network on telephony
   schematics. Later it was used to depict the Internet in [79]computer
   network diagrams. With this simplification, the implication is that the
   specifics of how the end points of a network are connected are not
   relevant for the purposes of understanding the diagram. The cloud
   symbol was used to represent networks of computing equipment in the
   original [80]ARPANET by as early as 1977,^[81][17] and the [82]CSNET by
   1981^[83][18]--both predecessors to the Internet itself.

   The term cloud has been used to refer to platforms for [84]distributed
   computing. In [85]Wired's April 1994 feature "Bill and Andy's Excellent
   Adventure II" on the [86]Apple spin-off [87]General Magic, [88]Andy
   Hertzfeld commented on General Magic's distributed programming language
   [89]Telescript that:

     "The beauty of Telescript ... is that now, instead of just having a
     device to program, we now have the entire Cloud out there, where a
     single program can go and travel to many different sources of
     information and create sort of a virtual service. No one had
     conceived that before. The example Jim White [the designer of
     Telescript, [90]X.400 and [91]ASN.1] uses now is a date-arranging
     service where a software agent goes to the flower store and orders
     flowers and then goes to the ticket shop and gets the tickets for
     the show, and everything is communicated to both parties."

   -- ^[92][19]

   References to "cloud computing" in its modern sense appeared as early
   as 1996, with the earliest known mention in a [93]Compaq internal
   document.^[94][20] The popularization of the term can be traced to 2006
   when Amazon.com introduced its [95]Elastic Compute Cloud.^[96][21]

1970s[[97]edit]

   During the 1960s, the initial concepts of time-sharing became
   popularized via RJE ([98]Remote Job Entry);^[99][22] this terminology
   was mostly associated with large vendors such as [100]IBM and [101]DEC.
   Full time-sharing solutions were available by the early 1970s on such
   platforms as Multics (on GE hardware), Cambridge CTSS, and the earliest
   UNIX ports (on DEC hardware). Yet, the "data center" model where users
   submitted jobs to operators to run on IBM mainframes was overwhelmingly
   predominant.

1990s[[102]edit]

   In the 1990s, telecommunications companies, who previously offered
   primarily dedicated point-to-point data circuits, began offering
   [103]virtual private network (VPN) services with comparable quality of
   service, but at a lower cost. By switching traffic as they saw fit to
   balance server use, they could use overall network bandwidth more
   effectively.^[[104]citation needed] They began to use the cloud symbol
   to denote the demarcation point between what the provider was
   responsible for and what users were responsible for. Cloud computing
   extended this boundary to cover all servers as well as the network
   infrastructure.^[105][23] As computers became more diffused, scientists
   and technologists explored ways to make large-scale computing power
   available to more users through time-sharing.^[[106]citation needed]
   They experimented with algorithms to optimize the infrastructure,
   platform, and applications to prioritize CPUs and increase efficiency
   for end users.^[107][24]

2000s[[108]edit]

   Since 2000, cloud computing has come into existence. In early 2008,
   [109]NASA's [110]OpenNebula, enhanced in the RESERVOIR European
   Commission-funded project, became the first open-source software for
   deploying private and hybrid clouds, and for the federation of
   clouds.^[111][25] In the same year, efforts were focused on providing
   [112]quality of service guarantees (as required by real-time
   interactive applications) to cloud-based infrastructures, in the
   framework of the IRMOS European Commission-funded project, resulting in
   a real-time cloud environment.^[113][26]^[114][27] By mid-2008, Gartner
   saw an opportunity for cloud computing "to shape the relationship among
   consumers of IT services, those who use IT services and those who sell
   them"^[115][28] and observed that "organizations are switching from
   company-owned hardware and software assets to per-use service-based
   models" so that the "projected shift to computing ... will result in
   dramatic growth in IT products in some areas and significant reductions
   in other areas."^[116][29]

   In August 2006 [117]Amazon introduced its [118]Elastic Compute
   Cloud.^[119][21] [120]Microsoft Azure was announced as "Azure" in
   October 2008 and was released on 1 February 2010 as Windows Azure,
   before being renamed to Microsoft Azure on 25 March 2014.^[121][30] In
   July 2010, [122]Rackspace Hosting and [123]NASA jointly launched an
   open-source cloud-software initiative known as [124]OpenStack. The
   OpenStack project intended to help organizations offering
   cloud-computing services running on standard hardware. The early code
   came from NASA's [125]Nebula platform as well as from [126]Rackspace's
   Cloud Files platform. As an open source offering and along with other
   open-source solutions such as CloudStack, Ganeti and OpenNebula, it has
   attracted attention by several key communities. Several studies aim at
   comparing these open sources offerings based on a set of
   criteria.^[127][31] ^[128][32] ^[129][33] ^[130][34] ^[131][35]
   ^[132][36] ^[133][37]
   On March 1, 2011, IBM announced the [134]IBM SmartCloud framework to
   support [135]Smarter Planet.^[136][38] Among the various components of
   the [137]Smarter Computing foundation, cloud computing is a critical
   part. On June 7, 2012, Oracle announced the [138]Oracle
   Cloud.^[139][39] While aspects of the Oracle Cloud are still in
   development, this cloud offering is poised to be the first to provide
   users with access to an integrated set of IT solutions, including the
   Applications ([140]SaaS), Platform ([141]PaaS), and Infrastructure
   ([142]IaaS) layers.^[143][40]^[144][41]^[145][42]

   In April of 2008, [146]Google released [147]Google App Engine in
   beta.^[148][43] In May of 2012, [149]Google Compute Engine was released
   in preview, before being rolled out into General Availability in
   December of 2013.^[150][44]

Similar concepts[[151]edit]

   Cloud computing is the result of the evolution and adoption of existing
   technologies and paradigms. The goal of cloud computing is to allow
   users to take benefit from all of these technologies, without the need
   for deep knowledge about or expertise with each one of them. The cloud
   aims to cut costs, and helps the users focus on their core business
   instead of being impeded by IT obstacles.^[152][45] The main enabling
   technology for cloud computing is [153]virtualization. Virtualization
   software separates a physical computing device into one or more
   "virtual" devices, each of which can be easily used and managed to
   perform computing tasks. With [154]operating system-level
   virtualization essentially creating a scalable system of multiple
   independent computing devices, idle computing resources can be
   allocated and used more efficiently. Virtualization provides the
   agility required to speed up IT operations, and reduces cost by
   increasing infrastructure [155]utilization. Autonomic computing
   automates the process through which the user can provision resources
   [156]on-demand. By minimizing user involvement, automation speeds up
   the process, reduces labor costs and reduces the possibility of human
   errors.^[157][45] Users routinely face difficult business problems.
   Cloud computing adopts concepts from [158]Service-oriented Architecture
   (SOA) that can help the user break these problems into [159]services
   that can be integrated to provide a solution. Cloud computing provides
   all of its resources as services, and makes use of the well-established
   standards and best practices gained in the domain of SOA to allow
   global and easy access to cloud services in a standardized way.

   Cloud computing also leverages concepts from utility computing to
   provide [160]metrics for the services used. Such metrics are at the
   core of the public cloud pay-per-use models. In addition, measured
   services are an essential part of the feedback loop in autonomic
   computing, allowing services to scale on-demand and to perform
   automatic failure recovery. Cloud computing is a kind of [161]grid
   computing; it has evolved by addressing the QoS (quality of service)
   and [162]reliability problems. Cloud computing provides the tools and
   technologies to build data/compute intensive parallel applications with
   much more affordable prices compared to traditional [163]parallel
   computing techniques.^[164][45]

   Cloud computing shares characteristics with:
     * [165]Client-server model--Client-server computing refers broadly to
       any [166]distributed application that distinguishes between service
       providers (servers) and service requestors (clients).^[167][46]
     * [168]Computer bureau--A [169]service bureau providing computer
       services, particularly from the 1960s to 1980s.
     * [170]Grid computing--"A form of distributed and parallel computing,
       whereby a 'super and virtual computer' is composed of a
       [171]cluster of networked, [172]loosely coupled computers acting in
       concert to perform very large tasks."
     * [173]Fog computing--Distributed computing paradigm that provides
       data, compute, storage and application services closer to client or
       near-user edge devices, such as network routers. Furthermore, fog
       computing handles data at the network level, on smart devices and
       on the end-user client side (e.g. mobile devices), instead of
       sending data to a remote location for processing.
     * [174]Dew computing--In the existing computing hierarchy, the Dew
       computing is positioned as the ground level for the cloud and fog
       computing paradigms. Compared to fog computing, which supports
       emerging IoT applications that demand real-time and predictable
       latency and the dynamic network reconfigurability, Dew computing
       pushes the frontiers to computing applications, data, and low level
       services away from centralized virtual nodes to the end
       users.^[175][47]
     * [176]Mainframe computer--Powerful computers used mainly by large
       organizations for critical applications, typically bulk data
       processing such as: [177]census; industry and consumer statistics;
       police and secret intelligence services; [178]enterprise resource
       planning; and financial [179]transaction processing.
     * [180]Utility computing--The "packaging of [181]computing resources,
       such as computation and storage, as a metered service similar to a
       traditional public utility, such as
       electricity."^[182][48]^[183][49]
     * [184]Peer-to-peer--A distributed architecture without the need for
       central coordination. Participants are both suppliers and consumers
       of resources (in contrast to the traditional client-server model).
     * Green computing
     * [185]Cloud sandbox--A live, isolated computer environment in which
       a program, code or file can run without affecting the application
       in which it runs.

Characteristics[[186]edit]

   Cloud computing exhibits the following key characteristics:
     * Agility for organizations may be improved, as cloud computing may
       increase users' flexibility with re-provisioning, adding, or
       expanding technological infrastructure resources.
     * Cost reductions are claimed by cloud providers. A public-cloud
       delivery model converts [187]capital expenditures (e.g., buying
       servers) to [188]operational expenditure.^[189][50] This
       purportedly lowers [190]barriers to entry, as infrastructure is
       typically provided by a third party and need not be purchased for
       one-time or infrequent intensive computing tasks. Pricing on a
       utility computing basis is "fine-grained", with usage-based billing
       options. As well, less in-house IT skills are required for
       implementation of projects that use cloud computing.^[191][51] The
       e-FISCAL project's state-of-the-art repository^[192][52] contains
       several articles looking into cost aspects in more detail, most of
       them concluding that costs savings depend on the type of activities
       supported and the type of infrastructure available in-house.
     * [193]Device and location independence^[194][53] enable users to
       access systems using a web browser regardless of their location or
       what device they use (e.g., PC, mobile phone). As infrastructure is
       off-site (typically provided by a third-party) and accessed via the
       Internet, users can connect to it from anywhere.^[195][51]
     * [196]Maintenance of cloud computing applications is easier, because
       they do not need to be installed on each user's computer and can be
       accessed from different places (e.g., different work locations,
       while travelling, etc.).
     * [197]Multitenancy enables sharing of resources and costs across a
       large pool of users thus allowing for:
          + centralization of infrastructure in locations with lower costs
            (such as real estate, electricity, etc.)
          + peak-load capacity increases (users need not engineer and pay
            for the resources and equipment to meet their highest possible
            load-levels)
          + utilisation and efficiency improvements for systems that are
            often only 10-20% utilised.^[198][54]^[199][55]
     * [200]Performance is monitored by IT experts from the service
       provider, and consistent and loosely coupled architectures are
       constructed using [201]web services as the system
       interface.^[202][51]^[203][56]^[204][57]
     * [205]Resource pooling is the provider's computing resources are
       commingle to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model
       with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned
       and reassigned according to user demand. There is a sense of
       location independence in that the consumer generally have no
       control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided
       resource.[206][1]
     * [207]Productivity may be increased when multiple users can work on
       the same data simultaneously, rather than waiting for it to be
       saved and emailed. Time may be saved as information does not need
       to be re-entered when fields are matched, nor do users need to
       install application software upgrades to their computer.^[208][58]
     * Reliability improves with the use of multiple redundant sites,
       which makes well-designed cloud computing suitable for
       [209]business continuity and [210]disaster recovery.^[211][59]
     * Scalability and [212]elasticity via dynamic ("on-demand")
       [213]provisioning of resources on a fine-grained, self-service
       basis in near real-time^[214][60]^[215][61] (Note, the VM startup
       time varies by VM type, location, OS and cloud
       providers^[216][60]), without users having to engineer for peak
       loads.^[217][62]^[218][63]^[219][64] This gives the ability to
       scale up when the usage need increases or down if resources are not
       being used.^[220][65]
     * [221]Security can improve due to centralization of data, increased
       security-focused resources, etc., but concerns can persist about
       loss of control over certain sensitive data, and the lack of
       security for stored [222]kernels. Security is often as good as or
       better than other traditional systems, in part because service
       providers are able to devote resources to solving security issues
       that many customers cannot afford to tackle or which they lack the
       technical skills to address.^[223][66] However, the complexity of
       security is greatly increased when data is distributed over a wider
       area or over a greater number of devices, as well as in
       multi-tenant systems shared by unrelated users. In addition, user
       access to security [224]audit logs may be difficult or impossible.
       Private cloud installations are in part motivated by users' desire
       to retain control over the infrastructure and avoid losing control
       of information security.

   The [225]National Institute of Standards and Technology's definition of
   cloud computing identifies "five essential characteristics":

     On-demand self-service. A consumer can unilaterally provision
     computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as
     needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each
     service provider.

     Broad network access. Capabilities are available over the network
     and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by
     heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones,
     tablets, [226]laptops, and workstations).

     Resource pooling. The provider's computing resources are pooled to
     serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different
     physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned
     according to consumer demand.

     Rapid elasticity. Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and
     released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and
     inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities
     available for provisioning often appear unlimited and can be
     appropriated in any quantity at any time.
     Measured service. Cloud systems automatically control and optimize
     resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of
     abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage,
     processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can
     be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for
     both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.

Service models[[228]edit]

   Though [229]service-oriented architecture advocates "everything as a
   service" (with the acronyms EaaS or XaaS,^[230][67] or simply
   [231]aas),^[232][68] cloud-computing providers offer their "services"
   according to different models, of which the three standard models per
   [233]NIST are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service
   (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).^[234][2] These models offer
   increasing abstraction; they are thus often portrayed as a layers in a
   [235]stack: infrastructure-, platform- and
   software-as-a-service,^[236][69] but these need not be related. For
   example, one can provide SaaS implemented on physical machines (bare
   metal), without using underlying PaaS or IaaS layers, and conversely
   one can run a program on IaaS and access it directly, without wrapping
   it as SaaS.
   Cloud computing service models arranged as layers in a stack

   The [237]NIST's definition of cloud computing defines the service
   models as follows:^[238][2]

     Software as a Service (SaaS). The capability provided to the
     consumer is to use the provider's applications running on a cloud
     infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client
     devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web
     browser (e.g., web-based email), or a program interface. The
     consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud
     infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems,
     storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the
     possible exception of limited user-specific application
     configuration settings.

     Platform as a Service (PaaS). The capability provided to the
     consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created
     or acquired applications created using programming languages,
     libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider. The
     consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud
     infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or
     storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly
     configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.

     Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The capability provided to the
     consumer is to provision processing, storage, networks, and other
     fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy
     and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and
     applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying
     cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems,
     storage, and deployed applications; and possibly limited control of
     select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)[[239]edit]

   See also: [240]Category:Cloud infrastructure

   According to the [241]Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the most
   basic cloud-service model is that of providers offering computing
   infrastructure - [242]virtual machines and other resources - as a
   service to subscribers. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) refers to
   online services that provide high-level [243]APIs used to
   [244]dereference various low-level details of underlying network
   infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data
   partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc. A [245]hypervisor, such as
   [246]Xen, [247]Oracle VirtualBox, [248]Oracle VM, [249]KVM, [250]VMware
   ESX/ESXi, or [251]Hyper-V, LXD, runs the virtual machines as guests.
   Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support
   large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up
   and down according to customers' varying requirements. Linux containers
   run in isolated partitions of a single [252]Linux kernel running
   directly on the physical hardware. Linux [253]cgroups and namespaces
   are the underlying Linux kernel technologies used to isolate, secure
   and manage the containers. Containerisation offers higher performance
   than virtualization, because there is no hypervisor overhead. Also,
   container capacity auto-scales dynamically with computing load, which
   eliminates the problem of over-provisioning and enables usage-based
   billing.^[254][70] IaaS clouds often offer additional resources such as
   a virtual-machine [255]disk-image library, raw [256]block storage, file
   or [257]object storage, firewalls, load balancers, IP addresses,
   [258]virtual local area networks (VLANs), and software
   bundles.^[259][71]

   IaaS-cloud providers supply these resources on-demand from their large
   pools of equipment installed in [260]data centers. For [261]wide-area
   connectivity, customers can use either the Internet or [262]carrier
   clouds (dedicated [263]virtual private networks). To deploy their
   applications, cloud users install operating-system images and their
   application software on the cloud
   infrastructure.^[264][72]^[[265]unreliable source?] In this model, the
   cloud user patches and maintains the operating systems and the
   application software. Cloud providers typically bill IaaS services on a
   utility computing basis: cost reflects the amount of resources
   allocated and consumed.^[266][73]^[267][74]^[268][75]^[269][76]

Platform as a service (PaaS)[[270]edit]

   Main article: [271]Platform as a service
   See also: [272]Category:Cloud platforms

   PaaS vendors offer a development environment to application developers.
   The provider typically develops toolkit and standards for development
   and channels for distribution and payment. In the PaaS models, cloud
   providers deliver a [273]computing platform, typically including
   operating system, programming-language execution environment, database,
   and web server. Application developers can develop and run their
   software solutions on a cloud platform without the cost and complexity
   of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layers.
   With some PaaS offers like [274]Microsoft Azure and [275]Google App
   Engine, the underlying computer and storage resources scale
   automatically to match application demand so that the cloud user does
   not have to allocate resources manually. The latter has also been
   proposed by an architecture aiming to facilitate real-time in cloud
   environments.^[276][77]^[[277]need quotation to verify] Even more
   specific application types can be provided via PaaS, such as media
   encoding as provided by services like bitcodin.com^[278][78] or
   media.io.^[279][79]

   Some integration and data management providers have also embraced
   specialized applications of PaaS as delivery models for data solutions.
   Examples include iPaaS (Integration Platform as a Service) and dPaaS
   (Data Platform as a Service). iPaaS enables customers to develop,
   execute and govern integration flows.^[280][80] Under the iPaaS
   integration model, customers drive the development and deployment of
   integrations without installing or managing any hardware or
   middleware.^[281][81] dPaaS delivers integration--and
   data-management--products as a fully managed service.^[282][82] Under
   the dPaaS model, the PaaS provider, not the customer, manages the
   development and execution of data solutions by building tailored data
   applications for the customer. dPaaS users retain transparency and
   control over data through [283]data-visualization tools.^[284][83]
   Platform as a Service (PaaS) consumers do not manage or control the
   underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating
   systems, or storage, but have control over the deployed applications
   and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting
   environment.

   A recent specialized PaaS is the [285]Blockchain as a Service (BaaS),
   that some vendors such as IBM Bluemix have already included in their
   PaaS offering.^[286][84]

Software as a service (SaaS)[[287]edit]

   Main article: [288]Software as a service

   In the software as a service (SaaS) model, users gain access to
   application software and databases. Cloud providers manage the
   infrastructure and platforms that run the applications. SaaS is
   sometimes referred to as "on-demand software" and is usually priced on
   a pay-per-use basis or using a subscription fee.^[289][85] In the SaaS
   model, cloud providers install and operate application software in the
   cloud and cloud users access the software from cloud clients. Cloud
   users do not manage the cloud infrastructure and platform where the
   application runs. This eliminates the need to install and run the
   application on the cloud user's own computers, which simplifies
   maintenance and support. Cloud applications differ from other
   applications in their scalability--which can be achieved by cloning
   tasks onto multiple [290]virtual machines at run-time to meet changing
   work demand.^[291][86] [292]Load balancers distribute the work over the
   set of virtual machines. This process is transparent to the cloud user,
   who sees only a single access-point. To accommodate a large number of
   cloud users, cloud applications can be [293]multitenant, meaning that
   any machine may serve more than one cloud-user organization.

   The pricing model for SaaS applications is typically a monthly or
   yearly flat fee per user,^[294][87] so prices become scalable and
   adjustable if users are added or removed at any point.^[295][88]
   Proponents claim that SaaS gives a [296]business the potential to
   reduce IT operational costs by outsourcing hardware and software
   maintenance and support to the cloud provider. This enables the
   business to reallocate IT operations costs away from hardware/software
   spending and from personnel expenses, towards meeting other goals. In
   addition, with applications hosted centrally, updates can be released
   without the need for users to install new software. One drawback of
   SaaS comes with storing the users' data on the cloud provider's server.
   As a result,^[[297]citation needed] there could be unauthorized access
   to the data. For this reason, users are increasingly^[[298]quantify]
   adopting intelligent third-party [299]key-management systems to help
   secure their data.^[[300]citation needed]

Security as a service (SECaaS)[[301]edit]

   Main article: [302]Security as a service

   Security as a service (SECaaS) is a [303]business model in which a
   large [304]service provider integrates their security services into a
   corporate infrastructure on a subscription basis more cost effectively
   than most individuals or corporations can provide on their own, when
   [305]total cost of ownership is considered. In this scenario, security
   is delivered as a [306]service from the cloud,^[307][89] without
   requiring on-premises hardware avoiding substantial capital outlays.
   These security services often include [308]authentication,
   [309]anti-virus, [310]anti-malware/spyware, [311]intrusion detection,
   and [312]security event management, among others.^[313][90]

Mobile "backend" as a service (MBaaS)[[314]edit]

   Main article: [315]Mobile backend as a service

   In the mobile "backend" as a service (m) model, also known as backend
   as a service (BaaS), [316]web app and [317]mobile app developers are
   provided with a way to link their applications to [318]cloud storage
   and cloud computing services with [319]application programming
   interfaces (APIs) exposed to their applications and custom
   [320]software development kits (SDKs). Services include user
   management, [321]push notifications, integration with [322]social
   networking services^[323][91] and more. This is a relatively recent
   model in cloud computing,^[324][92] with most BaaS [325]startups dating
   from 2011 or later^[326][93]^[327][94]^[328][95] but trends indicate
   that these services are gaining significant mainstream traction with
   enterprise consumers.^[329][96]

Serverless computing[[330]edit]

   Main article: [331]Serverless computing

   Serverless computing is a cloud computing code [332]execution model in
   which the cloud provider fully manages starting and stopping
   [333]virtual machines as necessary to serve requests, and requests are
   billed by an abstract measure of the resources required to satisfy the
   request, rather than per virtual machine, per hour.^[334][97] Despite
   the name, it does not actually involve running code without
   servers.^[335][97] Serverless computing is so named because the
   business or person that owns the system does not have to purchase, rent
   or provision servers or virtual machines for the [336]back-end code to
   run on.

Cloud clients[[337]edit]

   See also: [338]Category:Cloud clients and [339]Cloud API

   Users access cloud computing using networked client devices, such as
   [340]desktop computers, [341]laptops, [342]tablets and [343]smartphones
   and any [344]Ethernet-enabled device such as Home Automation Gadgets.
   Some of these devices--cloud clients--rely on cloud computing for all
   or a majority of their applications so as to be essentially useless
   without it. Examples are [345]thin clients and the browser-based
   [346]Chromebook. Many cloud applications do not require specific
   software on the client and instead use a web browser to interact with
   the cloud application. With [347]Ajax and [348]HTML5 these [349]Web
   user interfaces can achieve a similar, or even better, [350]look and
   feel to native applications. Some cloud applications, however, support
   specific client software dedicated to these applications (e.g.,
   [351]virtual desktop clients and most email clients). Some legacy
   applications (line of business applications that until now have been
   prevalent in thin client computing) are delivered via a screen-sharing
   technology.

Deployment models[[352]edit]

   Cloud computing types

Private cloud[[353]edit]

   Private cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single
   organization, whether managed internally or by a third-party, and
   hosted either internally or externally.^[354][2] Undertaking a private
   cloud project requires significant engagement to virtualize the
   business environment, and requires the organization to reevaluate
   decisions about existing resources. It can improve business, but every
   step in the project raises security issues that must be addressed to
   prevent serious vulnerabilities. Self-run [355]data centers^[356][98]
   are generally capital intensive. They have a significant physical
   footprint, requiring allocations of space, hardware, and environmental
   controls. These assets have to be refreshed periodically, resulting in
   additional capital expenditures. They have attracted criticism because
   users "still have to buy, build, and manage them" and thus do not
   benefit from less hands-on management,^[357][99] essentially "[lacking]
   the economic model that makes cloud computing such an intriguing
   concept".^[358][100]^[359][101]

Public cloud[[360]edit]

   A cloud is called a "public cloud" when the services are rendered over
   a network that is open for public use. Public cloud services may be
   free.^[361][102] Technically there may be little or no difference
   between public and private cloud architecture, however, security
   consideration may be substantially different for services
   (applications, storage, and other resources) that are made available by
   a service provider for a public audience and when communication is
   effected over a non-trusted network. Generally, public cloud service
   providers like [362]Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft and Google own
   and operate the infrastructure at their [363]data center and access is
   generally via the Internet. AWS and Microsoft also offer direct connect
   services called "AWS Direct Connect" and "Azure ExpressRoute"
   respectively, such connections require customers to purchase or lease a
   private connection to a peering point offered by the cloud
   provider.^[364][51]

Hybrid cloud[[365]edit]

   Hybrid cloud is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community
   or public) that remain distinct entities but are bound together,
   offering the benefits of multiple deployment models. Hybrid cloud can
   also mean the ability to connect collocation, managed and/or dedicated
   services with cloud resources.^[366][2] [367]Gartner, Inc. defines a
   hybrid cloud service as a cloud computing service that is composed of
   some combination of private, public and community cloud services, from
   different service providers.^[368][103] A hybrid cloud service crosses
   isolation and provider boundaries so that it can't be simply put in one
   category of private, public, or community cloud service. It allows one
   to extend either the capacity or the capability of a cloud service, by
   aggregation, integration or customization with another cloud service.

   Varied use cases for hybrid cloud composition exist. For example, an
   organization may store sensitive client data in house on a private
   cloud application, but interconnect that application to a business
   intelligence application provided on a public cloud as a software
   service.^[369][104] This example of hybrid cloud extends the
   capabilities of the enterprise to deliver a specific business service
   through the addition of externally available public cloud services.
   Hybrid cloud adoption depends on a number of factors such as data
   security and compliance requirements, level of control needed over
   data, and the applications an organization uses.^[370][105]

   Another example of hybrid cloud is one where [371]IT organizations use
   public cloud computing resources to meet temporary capacity needs that
   can not be met by the private cloud.^[372][106] This capability enables
   hybrid clouds to employ cloud bursting for scaling across
   clouds.^[373][2] Cloud bursting is an application deployment model in
   which an application runs in a private cloud or data center and
   "bursts" to a public cloud when the demand for computing capacity
   increases. A primary advantage of cloud bursting and a hybrid cloud
   model is that an organization pays for extra compute resources only
   when they are needed.^[374][107] Cloud bursting enables data centers to
   create an in-house IT infrastructure that supports average workloads,
   and use cloud resources from public or private clouds, during spikes in
   processing demands.^[375][108] The specialized model of hybrid cloud,
   which is built atop heterogeneous hardware, is called "Cross-platform
   Hybrid Cloud". A cross-platform hybrid cloud is usually powered by
   different CPU architectures, for example, x86-64 and ARM, underneath.
   Users can transparently deploy and scale applications without knowledge
   of the cloud's hardware diversity.^[376][109] This kind of cloud
   emerges from the raise of ARM-based system-on-chip for server-class
   computing.

Others[[377]edit]

Community cloud[[378]edit]

   [379]Community cloud shares infrastructure between several
   organizations from a specific community with common concerns (security,
   compliance, jurisdiction, etc.), whether managed internally or by a
   third-party, and either hosted internally or externally. The costs are
   spread over fewer users than a public cloud (but more than a private
   cloud), so only some of the cost savings potential of cloud computing
   are realized.^[380][2]

Distributed cloud[[381]edit]

   A cloud computing platform can be assembled from a distributed set of
   machines in different locations, connected to a single network or hub
   service. It is possible to distinguish between two types of distributed
   clouds: public-resource computing and volunteer cloud.
     * Public-resource computing--This type of distributed cloud results
       from an expansive definition of cloud computing, because they are
       more akin to distributed computing than cloud computing.
       Nonetheless, it is considered a sub-class of cloud computing, and
       some examples include distributed computing platforms such as
       [382]BOINC and [383]Folding@Home.
     * Volunteer cloud--Volunteer cloud computing is characterized as the
       intersection of public-resource computing and cloud computing,
       where a cloud computing infrastructure is built using volunteered
       resources. Many challenges arise from this type of infrastructure,
       because of the volatility of the resources used to built it and the
       dynamic environment it operates in. It can also be called
       peer-to-peer clouds, or ad-hoc clouds. An interesting effort in
       such direction is Cloud@Home, it aims to implement a cloud
       computing infrastructure using volunteered resources providing a
       business-model to incentivize contributions through financial
       restitution.^[384][110]

Intercloud[[385]edit]

   Main article: [386]Intercloud

   The [387]Intercloud^[388][111] is an interconnected global "cloud of
   clouds"^[389][112]^[390][113] and an extension of the Internet "network
   of networks" on which it is based. The focus is on direct
   [391]interoperability between public cloud service providers, more so
   than between providers and consumers (as is the case for hybrid- and
   multi-cloud).^[392][114]^[393][115]^[394][116]

Multicloud[[395]edit]

   Main article: [396]Multicloud

   Multicloud is the use of multiple cloud computing services in a single
   heterogeneous architecture to reduce reliance on single vendors,
   increase flexibility through choice, mitigate against disasters, etc.
   It differs from hybrid cloud in that it refers to multiple cloud
   services, rather than multiple deployment modes (public, private,
   legacy).^[397][117]^[398][118]^[399][119]

Architecture[[400]edit]

   Cloud computing sample architecture

   Cloud architecture,^[401][120] the [402]systems architecture of the
   [403]software systems involved in the delivery of cloud computing,
   typically involves multiple cloud components communicating with each
   other over a loose coupling mechanism such as a messaging queue.
   Elastic provision implies intelligence in the use of tight or loose
   coupling as applied to mechanisms such as these and others.

Cloud engineering[[404]edit]

   [405]Cloud engineering is the application of [406]engineering
   disciplines to cloud computing. It brings a systematic approach to the
   high-level concerns of commercialization, standardization, and
   governance in conceiving, developing, operating and maintaining cloud
   computing systems. It is a multidisciplinary method encompassing
   contributions from diverse areas such as [407]systems, [408]software,
   [409]web, [410]performance, [411]information, [412]security,
   [413]platform, [414]risk, and [415]quality engineering.

Security and privacy[[416]edit]

   Main article: [417]Cloud computing issues

   Cloud computing poses privacy concerns because the service provider can
   access the data that is in the cloud at any time. It could accidentally
   or deliberately alter or even delete information.^[418][121] Many cloud
   providers can share information with third parties if necessary for
   purposes of law and order even without a warrant. That is permitted in
   their privacy policies, which users must agree to before they start
   using cloud services. Solutions to privacy include policy and
   legislation as well as end users' choices for how data is
   stored.^[419][121] Users can encrypt data that is processed or stored
   within the cloud to prevent unauthorized access.^[420][3]^[421][121]

   According to the Cloud Security Alliance, the top three threats in the
   cloud are Insecure Interfaces and API's, Data Loss & Leakage, and
   Hardware Failure--which accounted for 29%, 25% and 10% of all cloud
   security outages respectively. Together, these form shared technology
   vulnerabilities. In a cloud provider platform being shared by different
   users there may be a possibility that information belonging to
   different customers resides on same data server. Therefore, Information
   leakage may arise by mistake when information for one customer is given
   to other.^[422][122] Additionally, [423]Eugene Schultz, chief
   technology officer at Emagined Security, said that hackers are spending
   substantial time and effort looking for ways to penetrate the cloud.
   "There are some real Achilles' heels in the cloud infrastructure that
   are making big holes for the bad guys to get into". Because data from
   hundreds or thousands of companies can be stored on large cloud
   servers, hackers can theoretically gain control of huge stores of
   information through a single attack--a process he called
   "hyperjacking". Some examples of this include the Dropbox security
   breach, and iCloud 2014 leak.^[424][123] Dropbox had been breached in
   October 2014, having over 7 million of its users passwords stolen by
   hackers in an effort to get monetary value from it by Bitcoins (BTC).
   By having these passwords, they are able to read private data as well
   as have this data be indexed by search engines (making the information
   public).^[425][123] There is the problem of legal ownership of the data
   (If a user stores some data in the cloud, can the cloud provider profit
   from it?). Many Terms of Service agreements are silent on the question
   of ownership.^[426][124] Physical control of the computer equipment
   (private cloud) is more secure than having the equipment off site and
   under someone else's control (public cloud). This delivers great
   incentive to public cloud computing service providers to prioritize
   building and maintaining strong management of secure
   services.^[427][125] Some small businesses that don't have expertise in
   [428]IT security could find that it's more secure for them to use a
   public cloud. There is the risk that end users do not understand the
   issues involved when signing on to a cloud service (persons sometimes
   don't read the many pages of the terms of service agreement, and just
   click "Accept" without reading). This is important now that cloud
   computing is becoming popular and required for some services to work,
   for example for an [429]intelligent personal assistant (Apple's
   [430]Siri or [431]Google Now). Fundamentally, private cloud is seen as
   more secure with higher levels of control for the owner, however public
   cloud is seen to be more flexible and requires less time and money
   investment from the user.^[432][126]

Limitations and disadvantages[[433]edit]

   According to [434]Bruce Schneier, "The downside is that you will have
   limited customization options. Cloud computing is cheaper because of
   [435]economics of scale, and - like any outsourced task - you tend to
   get what you get. A restaurant with a limited menu is cheaper than a
   personal chef who can cook anything you want. Fewer options at a much
   cheaper price: it's a feature, not a bug." He also suggests that "the
   cloud provider might not meet your legal needs" and that businesses
   need to weigh the benefits of cloud computing against the
   risks.^[436][127] In cloud computing, the control of the back end
   infrastructure is limited to the cloud vendor only. Cloud providers
   often decide on the management policies, which moderates what the cloud
   users are able to do with their deployment.^[437][128] Cloud users are
   also limited to the control and management of their applications, data
   and services.^[438][129] This includes data caps, which are placed on
   cloud users by the cloud vendor allocating certain amount of bandwidth
   for each customer and are often shared among other cloud
   users.^[439][130]

   Privacy and [440]confidentiality are big concerns in some activities.
   For instance, sworn translators working under the stipulations of an
   [441]NDA, might face problems regarding [442]sensitive data that are
   not [443]encrypted.^[444][131]

Emerging trends[[445]edit]

   Cloud computing is still a subject of research.^[446][132] A driving
   factor in the evolution of cloud computing has been [447]chief
   technology officers seeking to minimize risk of internal outages and
   mitigate the complexity of housing network and computing hardware
   in-house.^[448][133] Major cloud technology companies invest billions
   of dollars per year in cloud [449]Research and Development. For
   example, in 2011 Microsoft committed 90 percent of its $9.6 billion
   [450]R&D budget to its cloud.^[451][134] Research by investment bank
   Centaur Partners in late 2015 forecasted that SaaS revenue would grow
   from $13.5 billion in 2011 to $32.8 billion in 2016.^[452][135]
